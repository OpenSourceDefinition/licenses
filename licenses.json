The term \u201cSource Code\u201d means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.

Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor\u2019s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\n5) External Deployment. The term \u201cExternal Deployment\u201d means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.

You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \u201cAttribution Notice.\u201d You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \u201cAS IS\u201d BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against\u00a0Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n12) Attorneys\u2019 Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n14) Definition of \u201cYou\u201d in This License. \u201cYou\u201d throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \u201cYou\u201d includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright \u00a9 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the \u201cModified License\u201d) and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the \u201cAcademic Free License\u201d or \u201cAFL\u201d and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice \u201cLicensed under <insert your license name here>\u201d or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process."

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT\u2019S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE AND ITS TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH RECIPIENT READS THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. \u201cLICENSED WORK\u201d AND \u201cRECIPIENT\u201d ARE DEFINED BELOW.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This License is \u201cadaptive\u201d, and the generic version or another version of an Adaptive Public License should not be relied upon to determine your rights and obligations under this License. You must read the specific Adaptive Public License that you receive with the Licensed Work, as certain terms are defined at the outset by the Initial Contributor.\nSee Section 2.2 below, Exhibit A attached, and any Suppfile.txt accompanying this License to determine the specific adaptive features applicable to this License. For example, without limiting the foregoing, (a) for selected choice of law and jurisdiction see Part 3 of Exhibit A; (b) for the selected definition of Third Party see Part 4 of Exhibit A; and (c) for selected patent licensing terms (if any) see Section 2.2 below and Part 6 of Exhibit A.\n1.

In addition, a module does not qualify as an Independent Module but instead forms part of the Licensed Work if the module: (a) is embedded in the Licensed Work; (b) is included by reference in the Licensed Work other than by a function call or a class reference; or (c) must be included or contained, in whole or in part, within a file directory or subdirectory actually containing files making up the Licensed Work.\n1.8. \u201cINITIAL CONTRIBUTOR\u201d means the Person or entity identified as the Initial Contributor in the notice required by Part 1 of Exhibit A.\n1.9. \u201cINITIAL WORK\u201d means the initial Source Code, object code (if any) and documentation for the computer program identified in Part 2 of Exhibit A, as such Source Code, object code and documentation is distributed under this License by the Initial Contributor.\n1.10. \u201cLARGER WORK\u201d means a work that combines the Licensed Work or portions thereof with code not governed by this License.\n1.11. \u201cLICENSED WORK\u201d means the Initial Work and/or any Subsequent Work, in each case including portions thereof.\n1.12. \u201cLICENSE NOTICE\u201d has the meaning assigned in Part 5 of Exhibit A.\n1.13. \u201cMODIFICATION\u201d or \u201cMODIFICATIONS\u201d means any change to and/or addition to the Licensed Work.\n1.14. \u201cPERSON\u201d means an individual or other legal entity, including a corporation, partnership or other body.\n1.15. \u201cRECIPIENT\u201d means any Person who receives or obtains the Licensed Work under this License (by way of example, without limiting the foregoing, any Subsequent Contributor or Distributor).\n1.16. \u201cSOURCE CODE\u201d means the source code for a computer program, including the source code for all modules and components of the computer program, plus any associated interface definition files, and scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable.\n1.17. \u201cSUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR\u201d means any Person that makes or contributes to the making of any Subsequent Work and that distributes that Subsequent Work to at least one Third Party.\n1.18. \u201cSUBSEQUENT WORK\u201d means a work that has resulted or arises from changes to and/or additions to:\n(a) the Initial Work;\n(b) any other Subsequent Work; or\n(c) to any combination of the Initial Work and any such other Subsequent Work;\nwhere such changes and/or additions originate from a Subsequent Contributor. A Subsequent Work will \u201coriginate\u201d from a Subsequent Contributor if the Subsequent Work was a result of efforts by such Subsequent Contributor (or anyone acting on such Subsequent Contributor\u2019s behalf, such as, a contractor or other entity that is engaged by or under the direction of the Subsequent Contributor). For greater certainty, a Subsequent Work expressly excludes and shall not capture within its meaning any Independent Module.\n1.19. \u201cSUPPLEMENT FILE\u201d means a file distributed with the Licensed Work having a file name \u201csuppfile.txt\u201d.\n1.20. \u201cTHIRD PARTY\u201d has the meaning assigned in Part 4 of Exhibit A.\n2. LICENSE.\n2.1. COPYRIGHT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.\n(a) Subject to the terms of this License, the Initial Contributor hereby grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to:\n(i) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Initial Work; and\n(ii) reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;\nin Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications, on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.\n(b) Subject to the terms of this License, each Subsequent Contributor hereby grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to:\n(i) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Subsequent Work of such Subsequent Contributor; and\n(ii) reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;\nin Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications, on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.\n2.2. PATENT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.\n(a) This License does not include or grant any patent license whatsoever from the Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or any Distributor unless, at the time the Initial Work is first distributed or made available under this License (as the case may be), the Initial Contributor has selected pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. If this is not done then the Initial Work and any other Subsequent Work is made available under the License without any patent license (the \u201cPATENTS-EXCLUDED LICENSE\u201c).\n(b) However, the Initial Contributor may subsequently distribute or make available (as the case may be) future copies of: (1) the Initial Work; or (2) any Licensed Work distributed by the Initial Contributor which includes the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) and/or any Modification made by the Initial Contributor; available under a License which includes a patent license (the \u201cPATENTS-INCLUDED LICENSE\u201c) by selecting pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A, when the Initial Contributor distributes or makes available (as the case may be) such future copies under this License.\n(c) If any Recipient receives or obtains one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under the Patents-Included License, then all licensing of such copies under this License shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A and that Recipient shall not be able to rely upon the Patents-Excluded License for any such copies. However, all Recipients that receive one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under a copy of the License which includes the Patents-Excluded License shall have no patent license with respect to such copies received under the Patents-Excluded License and availability and distribution of such copies, including Modifications made by such Recipient to such copies, shall be under a copy of the License without any patent license.\n(d) Where a Recipient uses in combination or combines any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Excluded License with any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Included License, the combination (and any portion thereof) shall, from the first time such Recipient uses, makes available or distributes the combination (as the case may be), be subject to only the terms of the License having the Patents-Included License which shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A.\n2.3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND DISCLAIMER.\nRecipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and each Subsequent Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no representation, warranty, guarantee or assurance is provided by any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor that the Licensed Work does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise, in relation to the Licensed Works. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, without limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Licensed Work, it is Recipient\u2019s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Work.\n2.4. RESERVATION.\nNothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor except as expressly stated herein.\n3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.\n3.1. DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY.\n(a) A Subsequent Contributor shall make that Subsequent Contributor\u2019s Subsequent Work(s) available to the public via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism for a period of at least twelve (12) months. The aforesaid twelve (12) month period shall begin within a reasonable time after the creation of the Subsequent Work and no later than sixty (60) days after first distribution of that Subsequent Contributor\u2019s Subsequent Work.\n(b) All Distributors must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with the terms of the License, and must include a copy of this License (including without limitation Exhibit A and the accompanying Supplement File) with each copy of the Licensed Work distributed. In particular, this License must be prominently distributed with the Licensed Work in a file called \u201clicense.txt.\u201d In addition, the License Notice in Part 5 of Exhibit A must be included at the beginning of all Source Code files, and viewable to a user in any executable such that the License Notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any party using the Licensed Work.\n3.2. EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK.\nA Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in Executable form (an \u201cEXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION\u201c) to any third party, under the terms of Section 2 of this License, provided the Executable Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n(a) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source Code must be distributed on the same media as the Executable Distribution or using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism; or\n(b) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at least thirty six (36) months, to give any third party under the terms of this License, for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain available in Source Code form to any third party via the Electronic Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement Electronic Distribution Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn to as a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months.\nFor greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed Work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form, whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work or Independent Modules, or in some other combination.\n3.3. SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS.\nWhen a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, available to any Person in Source Code form, it must be made available under this License and a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Source Code, situated so that the copy of the License is conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater clarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the Licensed Work in any Source Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution.\n3.4. REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE.\nEach Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in Part 5 of Exhibit A is included in each file of the Source Code for each Subsequent Work originating from that particular Subsequent Contributor, if such notice is not already included in each such file. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\n3.5. NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS.\nNotwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally within its own corporation or organization use the Licensed Work, including the Initial Work and Subsequent Works, and make Modifications for internal use within Recipient\u2019s own corporation or organization (collectively, \u201cINTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS\u201c). The Recipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable form, any such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such internal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a Third Party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this License. If the Recipient chooses to distribute any such Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient shall be deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first such instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4 inclusive.\n3.6. INDEPENDENT MODULES.\nThis License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, Distributor or any Recipient, and such Independent Modules may be licensed or made available under one or more separate license agreements.\n3.7. LARGER WORKS.\nAny Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by combining any of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and may distribute the Larger Work as one or more products. However, in any such case, Distributor or Recipient (as the case may be) must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work.\n3.8. DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS.\n(a) Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where the Initial Contributor also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor) must cause each Subsequent Work created or contributed to by that Subsequent Contributor to contain a file documenting the changes, in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the Supplement File, that such Subsequent Contributor made in the creation or contribution to that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement File exists or no requirements are set out in Part 1 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Subsequent Contributors to document changes that they make resulting in Subsequent Works.(b) The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the \u201cEARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\u201c) for documenting changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the Licensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the \u201cNEW DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\u201c) for documenting such changes.(c) Any Recipient receiving at any time any copy of an Initial Work or any Subsequent Work under a copy of this License (in each case, an \u201cEarlier LICENSED COPY\u201c) having the Earlier Description Requirements may choose, with respect to each such Earlier Licensed Copy, to comply with the Earlier Description Requirements or the New Description Requirements. Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New Description Requirements, that Recipient will, when thereafter distributing any copies of any such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a Supplement File having a section entitled Part 1 that contains a copy of the New Description Requirements.(d) For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is to provide a mechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must document changes that they make to the Licensed Work resulting in Subsequent Works. Part 1 of any Supplement File shall not be used to increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of this License or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and obligations of any Recipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis for terminating the License. Further, a Recipient can be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with Part 1 of the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. Part 1 of any Supplement File is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed Work to the extent Part 1 sets out the requirements for documenting changes to the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work.(e) An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and contributions made by Subsequent Contributor is set out in Part 7 of Exhibit A of this License. Part 7 is a sample only and is not binding on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs of this Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor includes in Part 1 of the Supplement File with the copies of the Initial Work distributed under this License.\n3.9. USE OF DISTRIBUTOR NAME.\nThe name of a Distributor may not be used by any other Distributor to endorse or promote the Licensed Work or products derived from the Licensed Work, without prior written permission.\n3.10. LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR.\n(a) As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each time an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial Contributor\u2019s attribution information must occur (the \u201cATTRIBUTION INFORMATION\u201c). The Attribution Information must be included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For greater certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not a program dependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not require Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial Contributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one digital image or graphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL (collectively, the \u201cATTRIBUTION LIMITS\u201c).(b) If no Supplement File exists, or no Attribution Information is set out in Part 2 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Recipients to display any Attribution Information of the Initial Contributor.(c) Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within Part 2 of the Supplement File distributed with the Licensed Work are the exclusive property of the Initial Contributor and may only be used with the permission of the Initial Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as expressly set out in this License.\n3.11. For greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained within a Supplement File may only be used to specify the nature of the description or attribution requirements, as the case may be. Any provision in a Supplement File that otherwise purports to modify, vary, nullify or amend any right, obligation or representation contained herein shall be deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect.\n4. COMMERCIAL USE AND INDEMNITY.\n4.1. COMMERCIAL SERVICES.\nA Recipient (\u201cCOMMERCIAL RECIPIENT\u201c) may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations (collectively, \u201cSERVICES\u201c) to one or more other Recipients or Distributors. However, such Commercial Recipient may do so only on that Commercial Recipient\u2019s own behalf, and not on behalf of any other Distributor or Recipient, and Commercial Recipient must make it clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation(s) is/are offered by Commercial Recipient alone. At no time may Commercial Recipient use any Services to deny any party the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form when so required under any of the other terms of this License. For greater certainty, this Section 4.1 does not diminish any of the other terms of this License, including without limitation the obligation of the Commercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing any of the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form, to make such distribution royalty-free (subject to the right to charge a fee of no more than the cost of physically performing Source Code or Executable distribution (as the case may be)).\n4.2. INDEMNITY.\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this License is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Licensed Work, the Distributor who includes any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services, such Distributor (\u201cCOMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR\u201c) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case an \u201cINDEMNIFIED PARTY\u201c) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \u201cLOSSES\u201c) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Party must: (a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim; and (b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and co-operate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Party may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n5. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\n5.1. NEW VERSIONS.\nThe Initial Contributor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n5.2. EFFECT OF NEW VERSIONS.\nOnce the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by Initial Contributor under a particular version of the License, Recipient may choose to continue to use it under the terms of that version. However, if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed Work under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the Initial Contributor, then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further reproduction, preparation of derivative works, public display of, public performance of, distribution and sublicensing by the Recipient in connection with the Licensed Work. No one other than the Initial Contributor has the right to modify the terms applicable to the Licensed Work\n6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n6.1. GENERAL DISCLAIMER.\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, ASSURANCE OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK IS WITH RECIPIENT. SHOULD ANY LICENSED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, RECIPIENT (NOT THE INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR OR ANY SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUMES THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS CLAUSE CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY LICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS LICENSE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS DISCLAIMER.\n6.2. RESPONSIBILITY OF RECIPIENTS.\nEach Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Licensed Work and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n7. TERMINATION.\n7.1. This License shall continue until terminated in accordance with the express terms herein.\n7.2. Recipient may choose to terminate this License automatically at any time.\n7.3. This License, including without limitation the rights granted hereunder to a particular Recipient, will terminate automatically if such Recipient is in material breach of any of the terms of this License and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days of becoming aware of the breach. Without limiting the foregoing, any material breach by such Recipient of any term of any other License under which such Recipient is granted any rights to the Licensed Work shall constitute a material breach of this License.\n7.4. Upon termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient for any reason, all rights granted hereunder and under any other License to that Recipient shall terminate. However, all sublicenses to the Licensed Work which were previously properly granted by such Recipient under a copy of this License (in each case, an \u201cOther License\u201d and in plural, \u201cOther Licenses\u201d) shall survive any such termination of this License, including without limitation the rights and obligations under such Other Licenses as set out in their respective Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, mutatis mutandis, for so long as the respective sublicensees (i.e. other Recipients) remain in compliance with the terms of the copy of this License under which such sublicensees received rights to the Licensed Work. Any termination of such Other Licenses shall be pursuant to their respective Section 7, mutatis mutandis. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n7.5. Upon any termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient, Sections 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, and 8.2, together with all provisions of this License necessary for the interpretation and enforcement of same, shall expressly survive such termination.\n8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n8.1. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND/OR AGENTS (AS THE CASE MAY BE), HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, INDIRECT DAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SPECIAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, OR ANY OTHER LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, PERFORMANCE, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK OR ANY PART THEREOF OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR THAT RESULT FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS, OMISSIONS, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) IN RELATION TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY\u2019S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.\n9. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL ACTION.\n9.1. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Governing Jurisdiction assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. No party may bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of the action arose. Each party waives its rights (if any) to a jury trial in any litigation arising under this License. Note that if the Governing Jurisdiction is not assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, then the Governing Jurisdiction shall be the State of New York.\n9.2. The courts of the Governing Jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction, but not exclusive jurisdiction, to entertain and determine all disputes and claims, whether for specific performance, injunction, damages or otherwise, both at law and in equity, arising out of or in any way relating to this License, including without limitation, the legality, validity, existence and enforceability of this License. Each party to this License hereby irrevocably attorns to and accepts the jurisdiction of the courts of the Governing Jurisdiction for such purposes.\n9.3. Except as expressly set forth elsewhere herein, in the event of any action or proceeding brought by any party against another under this License the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including the fees of its attorneys in such action or proceeding in such amount as the court may adjudge reasonable.\n10. MISCELLANEOUS.\n10.1. The obligations imposed by this License are for the benefit of the Initial Contributor and any Recipient, and each Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Contributor and/or any other Recipient may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against any Recipient.\n10.2.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n10.4. The language in all parts of this License shall be in all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the parties hereto. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n10.5. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under the laws of the Governing Jurisdiction, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n10.6. The paragraph headings of this License are for reference and convenience only and are not a part of this License, and they shall have no effect upon the construction or interpretation of any part hereof.\n10.7. Each of the terms \u201cincluding\u201d, \u201cinclude\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d, when used in this License, is not limiting whether or not non-limiting language (such as \u201cwithout limitation\u201d or \u201cbut not limited to\u201d or words of similar import) is used with reference thereto.\n10.8. The parties hereto acknowledge they have expressly required that this License and notices relating thereto be drafted in the English language.\n//***THE LICENSE TERMS END HERE (OTHER THAN AS SET OUT IN EXHIBIT A).***//\nEXHIBIT A (to the Adaptive Public License)\nPART 1: INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR AND DESIGNATED WEB SITE\n\n\n\nThe Initial Contributor is:\n____________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n[Enter full name of Initial Contributor]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress of Initial Contributor:\n________________________________________________\n\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n[Enter address above]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Designated Web Site is:\n__________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n[Enter URL for Designated Web Site of Initial Contributor]\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The Initial Contributor is to complete this Part 1, along with Parts 2, 3, and 5, and, if applicable, Parts 4 and 6.\nPART 2: INITIAL WORK\nThe Initial Work comprises the computer program(s) distributed by the Initial Contributor having the following title(s): _______________________________________________.\nThe date on which the Initial Work was first available under this License: _________________\nPART 3: GOVERNING JURISDICTION\nFor the purposes of this License, the Governing Jurisdiction is _________________________________________________.\n[Initial Contributor to Enter Governing Jurisdiction here]\nPART 4: THIRD PARTIES\nFor the purposes of this License, \u201cThird Party\u201d has the definition set forth below in the ONE paragraph selected by the Initial Contributor from paragraphs A, B, C, D and E when the Initial Work is distributed or otherwise made available by the Initial Contributor.

If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this License, please do not download or use the software.\n1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Computer, Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or work as \u201cOriginal Code\u201d and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 2.0 (\u201cLicense\u201d). As used in this License:\n1.1 \u201cApplicable Patent Rights\u201d mean:\n(a) in the case where Apple is the grantor of rights,\n(i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and\n(ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and\n(b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights,\n(i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and\n(ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.\n1.2 \u201cContributor\u201d means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications.\n1.3 \u201cCovered Code\u201d means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.\n1.4 \u201cExternally Deploy\u201d means:\n(a) to sublicense, distribute or otherwise make Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than You; and/or\n(b) to use Covered Code, alone or as part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including but not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication with a client other than You.\n1.5 \u201cLarger Work\u201d means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n1.6 \u201cModifications\u201d mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is:\n(a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; and/or\n(b) any new file or other representation of computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.\n1.7 \u201cOriginal Code\u201d means\n(a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Apple under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such work; and\n(b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Apple under this License.\n1.8 \u201cSource Code\u201d means the human readable form of a program or other work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).\n1.9 \u201cYou\u201d or \u201cYour\u201d means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License. For legal entities, \u201cYou\u201d or \u201cYour\u201d includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where \u201ccontrol\u201d means\n(a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or\n(b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.\n2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple\u2019s Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:\n2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:\n(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and\n(b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients\u2019 rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.\n2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:\n(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;\n(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and\n(c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).\n2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.\n2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple\u2019s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.\n4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.\n5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (\u201cAdditional Terms\u201d) to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient\u2019s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.\n7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE\u2019S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cAPPLE\u201d FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple\u2019s total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\n10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names \u201cApple\u201d, \u201cApple Computer\u201d, \u201cMac\u201d, \u201cMac OS\u201d, \u201cQuickTime\u201d, \u201cQuickTime Streaming Server\u201d or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively \u201cApple Marks\u201d) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple\u2019s third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.\n11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple (\u201cApple Modifications\u201d), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\n12. Termination.\n12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.\n12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\n13. Miscellaneous.\n13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \u201ccommercial item\u201d as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data \u2014 Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\n13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple\u2019s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\n13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\n13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rediges en anglais.\nEXHIBIT A. \u201cPortions Copyright (c) 1999-2003 Apple Computer, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

        "license_body": "(NOTE: This license has been superseded by the Artistic License, Version 2.0.)\nThis version of the Artistic License 1.0 contains a clause introduced for licensing an implementation of the Perl programming language:\n8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package\u2019s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\nWithout this clause present, it is called simply the Artistic License 1.0 (abbreviated as Artistic-1.0. With or without this clause, the license is approved by OSI for certifying software as OSI Certified Open Source.\nThe Artistic License\nPreamble\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\nb) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\nc) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\na) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\nb) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\nc) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\n7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.\n8.Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\n9.

Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\nWith this clause present, it is called the Artistic License (Perl) 1.0 (abbreviated as Artistic-Perl-1.0. With or without this clause, the license is approved by OSI for certifying software as OSI Certified Open Source.\nOne such example is the Artistic License (Perl) 1.0.\nThe Artistic License\nPreamble\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\nb) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\nc) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\na) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\nb) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\nc) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\n7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.\n8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n9.

The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.\nYou are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.\nDefinitions\n\u201cCopyright Holder\u201d means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n\u201cContributor\u201d means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder\u2019s procedures.\n\u201cYou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.\n\u201cPackage\u201d means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\n\u201cDistribute\u201d means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n\u201cDistributor Fee\u201d means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.\n\u201cStandard Version\u201d refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n\u201cModified Version\u201d means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n\u201cOriginal License\u201d means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\u201cSource\u201d form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\n\u201cCompiled\u201d form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.\n(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under(i) the Original License or(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source\n(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.\nGeneral Provisions\n(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.\n(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\n(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.\n(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \u201cAS IS\u2019 AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE."
